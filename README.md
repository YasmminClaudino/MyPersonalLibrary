# MyPersonalLibrary

Welcome to My Personal Library! This project allows users to log in to their personal accounts, search for books using the Google Books API,
and manage their reading lists. You can add books to lists such as "Read," "Currently Reading," and "Want to Read."

## Problem 

I read a lot of books and don't know how to save and keep track of them.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Log in with your account to manage your personal library.
- **Search for Books**: Find books using the Google Books API.
- **Manage Reading Lists**: Organize books into "Read," "Currently Reading," and "Want to Read" lists.

Current our app loooks like this, but we are working to improve our prototype
